At Boston University, I teach introductory literature courses in the English department and a two-course sequence in academic writing and research for the Writing Program.

## Literature

## Writing

> “Pushes students to think a different way, or consider another way of writing.”

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – WR 100 Student (Fall 2013)

In addition to introductory literature courses, I have taught in Boston University’s CAS Writing Center, which offers all incoming undergraduates a year-long immersion in the practices of research and academic writing.

These semester-long seminar courses focus on a particular topic. My sections of WR 100 and WR 150 have covered topics in British and world literature, including modernist fiction and magazines, literatures of civil war, and fictional narratives about the British Empire. As part of our collaborative engagement with literature and history, each seminar built a course blog and/or research guide composed of topical essays, annotated bibliographies, and an interactive map and timeline tool. For example, in spring 2014 students used Omeka and Neatline to produce this [multimodal research guide](http://ryanweberling.com/outpostsofempire/) on Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*. The site was received positively by scholars and teachers interested in digital pedagogy.
