I&#8217;m putting together a panel proposal for this year&#8217;s Modernist Studies Association conference, which Boston University is co-hosting under the coordination of[ Carrie Preston](http://www.bu.edu/english/people/faculty/carrie-j-preston/). <!--more-->

The CFP, also posted at the [MSA website](http://bit.ly/modcivilwar), is copied below:

Wyndham Lewis&#8217;s Blast is perhaps the most famous modernist declaration of civil war: &#8220;We set Humour at Humour&#8217;s throat. / Stir up Civil War among peaceful apes.&#8221; Lewis himself was named after an eccentric English mercenary who fought in the U.S. Civil War (by his American father, a veteran of the same war), and he returns to the trope in his 1937 autobiography, Blasting and Bombardiering: &#8220;You will be astonished to find how like art is to war, I mean &#8216;modernist&#8217; art&#8230;I have set out to show how war, art, civil war, strikes and coup d&#8217;état dovetail into each other.&#8221;

This panel proposes extending recent interest in the Spanish Civil War to a comparative, structural, and intertextual analysis of internecine modernism. How does sectional conflict reframe our understanding of nationalism and world war? Papers could return to well-known national narratives, identify less familiar histories of schism, or develop new transnational or inter-historical approaches.

Topics and approaches might include:

  * global perspectives on southern modernism and the U.S. Civil War (what Winston Churchill described as the &#8220;least avoidable&#8221; conflict in history): reconsideration of Paul Giles&#8217;s 2003 statement that &#8220;returning so obsessively to the trauma of the Civil War indirectly asserts the primacy of traditional American ideals of federal unity and freedom&#8221;
  * comparative perspectives on interwar schism: pro-fascist writing on the Spanish Civil War, or conflict in Finland (1918), Ireland (1922), Ecuador (1923), Nicaragua (1926), Mexico (1926), China (1927), Brazil (1932), Austria (1934)
  * revisionary perspectives: civil war as precursor, corollary, or consequence of world war; World War I writing as literature of European Civil War
  * competing narratives: civil war as revolution, insurrection, slave revolt, independence movement, pan-nationalism, regionalism
  * new national allegories: partition, apartheid, secession, annexation, devolution, insurgency
  * modernist factions: networks, coteries, clubs, troupes, unions, conferences, societies, federations
  * modernism and transatlantic schism: the black Atlantic and double consciousness, Atlantic sectionalism, legacies of the English Civil Wars
  * interdisciplinary frameworks: economic and imperial history; political science and international relations
  * civil war in theory: Derrida&#8217;s &#8220;Declarations of Independence&#8221;; Nancy&#8217;s _The Inoperative Community_ or _Being Singular Plural_; Agamben&#8217;s _State of Exception_; Butler on precarity, dispossession, gender trouble

Contact Ryan Weberling (ryanweb@bu.edu) to discuss possibilities for the panel, or send a 300-word paper proposal by April 10.
