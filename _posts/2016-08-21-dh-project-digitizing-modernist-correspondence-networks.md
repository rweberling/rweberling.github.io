I&#8217;ve been working with the [Twentieth Century Literary Letters Project](http://www.modmaps.net/tcllp/) since 2012, when I took a course in Digital Humanities Databases at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute ([DHSI](http://www.dhsi.org)). My projects in this regard have focused on assembling and visualizing [the correspondence networks of Virginia Woolf](https://www.academia.edu/5671883/The_Social_Forms_of_Modernism_Visualizing_Literary_Sociability_in_Letters_to_Virginia_Woolf). I&#8217;m excited to be directing new energy toward this line of work in the following year, with the help of a fellowship and interdisciplinary Digital Humanities seminar sponsored by the Boston University Center for the Humanities ([BUCH](http://www.bu.edu/humanities/news/dh/)). I plan to explore data models and open source platforms for collecting and sharing [linked open metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) about modernist letters.

Why digital humanities? Why correspondence networks?

Early in my degree program, I became fascinated with the collections of fan mail received by Virginia Woolf. This material was made been accessible to scholars through editorial work by [Anna Snaith](http://www.pace.edu/media/files/paceunivesitypress/wsa6_toc.pdf), [Beth Rigel Daugherty](http://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/press/woolf-studies-annual/wsa-volume-12.pdf), and others (see also Melba Cuddy-Keane&#8217;s [discussion](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-248188946/from-fan-mail-to-readers-letters-locating-john-farrelly) of a few additional letters, and Sybil Oldfield&#8217;s [collection of letters received posthumously](https://books.google.com/books?id=wmE-VBl6DEQC&source=gbs_navlinks_s)). For me, the patterns of mutual influence recorded in some of these letters opened up alternative models of sociality and literary reception, relationships characterized by contingency and anonymity rather than intimacy or intentionality. They also didn&#8217;t fit with one of the most common frameworks for writing literary history: metaphors and social networks centered on the family. In an early paper presented to the International Virginia Woolf Society, I used a combination of queer theory and conventional close reading to describe these features in Woolf&#8217;s fan mail and to explore her connections to common readers and writers across the British Commonwealth and imperial diaspora.

However, I came to realize that my approach to these letters seemed to reinforce certain assumptions about interpersonal communication, self-possession, and inheritance. The [archive](http://www.thekeep.info/collections/monks-house-papers/) where many of these letters reside is named after the house Virginia Woolf shared with her husband, Leonard Woolf, and I like the archive continue to use &#8220;Virginia Woolf&#8221; as an organizing principle for collection and interpretation. By reading these letters closely, I was positioning myself between Woolf and her readers, in effect trying to identify or stage a moment of mutual connection and understanding. To understand contingency and anonymity as structural features of the relationship named by the popular expression &#8220;fan mail,&#8221; I needed a more distant and depersonalized perspective—perhaps a less humanistic method. That realization led me to begin exploring various methods of social network analysis and visualization. To understand how these letters and relationships were working through and beyond the rubric of families and generations, I needed to look not at the content of the letters—traditional humanistic data—but at their metadata: the features of time, place, text, and material that define the dispersion rather than the integration of a social network, its gaps and distances as well as the words and feelings that constitute it.
