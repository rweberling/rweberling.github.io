**Project Overview**

Writing in Paris at the height of the U.S. Civil War, the French politician and anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon predicted that “the twentieth century will open the age of federations.” His prediction took on new and suggestively figurative dimensions almost two decades later, when Virginia Woolf’s father, Leslie Stephen, adapted the idea of federation to the “microcosm” of mental order and individual “constitution”:

> Man, in fact, is a microcosm as complex as the world which is mirrored in his mind; he is a federation incompletely centralised, a hierarchy of numerous and conflicting passions…He is in some sense a unit, but his unity is such as to include an indefinite number of partly independent sensibilities…

Thought it may seem an incidental figure of speech, Stephen’s reference to federation took place at the outset of a transatlantic debate about the historiography of the British Empire and the future shape of state sovereignty. His metaphor of a federated self serves as an emblem of the overlapping literary and political concerns I explore in my dissertation, which describes how five modernist writers participated in the emergence of federalism as a mode of governance and structure of feeling. Examining the lives and writing of Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Jean Rhys, William Faulkner, and Salman Rushdie, I argue that their experiments with life narrative respond critically to “the age of federations” as it unfolds, enabling readers to sense—and potentially to shape—the changing constitutional arrangements of modern states.

Today, as more than 40% of the world’s population lives in states that are, or claim to be, federations (not including interstate organizations such as the EU), scholars in a variety of disciplines are reexamining the global history of federalism. My research places modernist texts at the center of this inquiry by considering their status and effects as constitutional narratives—narratives that revisit the origins of particular social relations in order to develop new perspectives on the present moment. Critics typically view literature’s relationship to the state with suspicion, whether because of the state’s protection of dominant interests or because they find it to be ultimately less important than other systems of order and exchange. I emphasize literature’s capacities for representation, in materially salient and politically transformative ways, particularly through its challenging of conventional images, attitudes, and narrative forms. I suggest that modernist fiction’s difficulty has to do with not only altering perceptions of the past but bringing contested histories to bear on the future of those abstract social and conceptual forms we sometimes refer to as government. In particular, I show how modernist fiction responds to the division of nation and world by what W. E. B. Du Bois described as “the color line.” For along with ideals of liberal citizenship and federated unity, the twentieth century was also an age defined by what Edward Kamau Braithwaite refers to as “negative federation”: that is, unification with and through “apartheid.”

Each chapter in my dissertation pairs a modernist writer with an important moment in the global history of federalism, using this context to develop a close reading of one of their novels. Chapters one and two bring new biographical and historical material to bear on Oscar Wilde’s _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1890) and Virginia Woolf’s _Orlando_ (1928), which in dialogue with the U.S. Civil War and debates about Irish and Indian self-determination, offer contrasting views of imperial history from the vantage point of cosmopolitan London. Chapters three and four consider the discrepancy between metropolitan and and colonial views of federation by turning to Jean Rhys’ _Voyage in the Dark_ (1934) and William Faulkner’s _Absalom, Absalom!_ (1936). These narratives challenge the ideal of political union based on racial sympathy by depicting young white protagonists who flee southern plantation economies but are unable integrate into northern cities. The dissertation ends with a chapter examining the role that “loose federalism,” as the narrator of Salman Rushdie’s _Midnight’s Children_ (1981) calls it, played in the decolonization and partition of India, now the world’s largest federal democracy.
