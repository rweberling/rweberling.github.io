Recent developments can be traced back to the rise of the Humanities &#8220;Institute.&#8221; Are literary labs a counterweight to or an emulation of the sciences as the bedrock of what is important in higher education, of what the university _is_? The creation of literary labs seems to promise some forms of change: different research questions, changing research practices, shifting institutional structures and professional relationships, new teaching strategies, etc.

Jeffrey Thompson Schnapp

  * founding the Stanford Humanities Laboratory: an oxymoron?
  * the term &#8220;digital&#8221; not necessary here? &#8220;laboratory&#8221; does the heavy lifting conceptually and methodologically, in at least 3 and a half ways: 
      * 1. research-driven/project-based
      * 2. collaborative/team projects for bigger pictures and larger questions (shared audiences): &#8220;big humanities&#8221; (like big science, big oil, etc.?)
      * 3. crosses boundaries between applied and theoretical research
      * 3.5 inspires economic and entrepreneurial awareness: streams of income and output that are aware of social and institutional needs/contexts/shortcomings
  * the humanities laboratory as a &#8220;knowledge design studio&#8221;

Laura Mandell

  * students learn literature better as a byproduct of a particular project that, by the way, requires expertise in a literary subdomain
  * the important of preserving a space for play in the literary lab? important for teachers and humanists who are concerned with the transitional space where political subjects are granted certain forms of agency

Matthew Jockers

  * assigned 1200 novels in a graduate &#8220;literary lab&#8221; seminar: 2 group research projects on (1) changes in style, and (2) lexical/semantic change
  * &#8220;if you build it, they will come&#8221;â€”there are some things a lab should have:
  * a clear research objective: not an idea generator but a place for ideas to live, move, and die; therefore, 5 objects that Stanford Lit Lab&#8217;s original operations: 
      * 1. quantitative projects
      * 2. collaborative basis (even if ends in single author)
      * 3. all projects are experimental (failed projects also produce new knowledge)
      * 4. open to students and faculty at all levels
      * 5. favored form of publication or research presentation is &#8220;lab report&#8221; that try to detail complete method and process

Mark Algee-Hewitt

  * <span style="line-height: 15px;">lab as space committed to heterogeneity</span>
