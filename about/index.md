## About Me

I am a graduate student in the [English Department](http://www.bu.edu/english) at Boston University, where I study transatlantic modernism and 20th-century Anglophone literature. I am also completing a graduate certificate in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. My research explores how experimental forms and styles of the *Bildungsroman*, or coming-of-age narrative, have participated in the global histories of federalism and colonialism.

Other projects include digitally mapping the letters and social networks of Virginia Woolf, in affiliation with the [Twentieth Century Literary Letters Project](http://www.modmaps.net/tcllp).
